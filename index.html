        <hr>
        <h3>Games that have a pay-to-win aspect attached to
            loot boxes also become difficult for consumers who
            do not purchase loot boxes as they cannot beat the
            pay-to-win players with their gear, forcing them to
            either purchase loot boxes or continue to lose.<br><br>
            These companies know exactly what they are doing
            and understand that they can profit greatly if
            consumers continue to purchase these loot boxes
            and accept the status quo.</h3>
